First the constant billing increases: I signed up for paperless billing and autopay and recently checked my bills to learn that my rate had been increased three or four times in 2 years. I had no idea because the only notification I received was a small line on the bill notifying me of an increase, yet with autopay and paperless billing, I missed this. There were no emails, calls.

So if you have the 4S I'm interested to know: What network are you on? What neighborhood(s) do you use your iPhone in the most? What results do you get on this speed test?

I recently upgraded to Verizon FiOS' Gigabit service, but having trouble reaching those speeds from pfSense, measuring via "`speedtest-cli`" on the pfSense console. I'm only getting 300-500Mbps, versus my max of \~940/780Mbps.

When I started playing pubg, I had a 100Mbit optical internet from my provider and at some point I upgraded it to 250Mbit, thinking it would improve pubg delayed action feeling. One evening we were playing pubg and a friend of mine had already lost the game, was spectating me, while waiting. And he says something like: "He got you!". For those who are nerds for statistics in networking, you're in the right post. amp#x200B; What's SmokePing? Smokeping is a latency measurement tool. It sends test packets out to the net and measures the amount of time they need to travel from one place to the other and back.

I'm running my own server from my house which is located at Batangas Province. So I found a Captive Portal Arduino sketch for esp8266. I then added some code in the HTML section that would give the victim instructions and the link to the password stealer. This project is entry level. Anyway they click on link and it take them to a website that (if they are stupid enough) they will enter thier WiFi network name and password.

So after installing a bunch of tweaks, I realised that certain apps would not rotate when auto rotate is disabled. For example when viewing videos, it should change to landscape when making it full screen, even if auto rotate is disabled. When I make youtube fullscreen, its in portrait mode, I would have to manually enable auto rotate. Same with games, which would rotate to landscape when I enter the app, but after installing tweaks, the games. Testing no doubt is an infinite and demanding process. The testers need to be well versed with a lot of skills in order to make sure that the end product is what the user is expecting! Whether it is capturing screenshots in run-time efficiently or estimating what to automate, testing has a lot of aspects to it. Thinking from someone else’s point of view and making sure that you do not miss out on anything is a challenge in itself and to sail your boat out of these troubled waters Hello again, me with another China Phone review, this time the rugged ZOJI Z33 (https://www.homtom.cc/HOMTOM-ZOJI-Z33-P273.html)!

(If this is the wrong place to post this, please point me to a more appropriate subreddit) My roommate and I have had Cox for the last 4 months and the experience has not been as good as I was expecting. We have the Preferred 100mbps package and here (https://www.speedtest.net/result/8025472719.png) is a recent speed test I did from my PC with nothing else on the network. However, I have a NAT type 3 on my PS4 which is preventing me from playing some online games with my friends. I'm currentl. So moved to another location in town, from an apartment to a house, a little closer to center of town. Same provider, same 100 mbps down and 20 mbps up package. We are running a Nighthawk CM1100 modem( https://www.costco.com/Netgear-Nighthawk-CM1100-DOCSIS-3.1-Cable-Modem.product.100464287.html (https://www.costco.com/Netgear-Nighthawk-CM1100-DOCSIS-3.1-Cable-Modem.product.100464287.html)) - at Costco for 5 right now, not that crap the provider hands out, and a Nighthawk R7000P AC2300 router(. https://cdn-vr.sexlikereal.com/benchmark/speed.html Every time you visit SLR site or app your connection is tested and videos are delivered from the server that performs the best speed from 10 locations all over the world including Europe, East Coast US, West Coast US, Canada, Australia and upcoming Singapore. Our speedtest performs several download streams in parallel to get better idea how good is your channel. I often use my unlimited 4G in EU and US to stream with GearVR. The problem. Anyone can do this, but this is made specifically for those that do not have fast internet and would like to see if the (rumored) 48 hours will be enough time to download the massive 105 Gigs this beast of a game requires. Note : If your console is on wireless, make sure your computer is when you run the test. ~~========================~~ Step 1: Run multiple speed tests from your computer by using the following links. Do not run all the tests at once as this will skew results Hi! I have almost 500hrs on pubg and I cannot seem to get any better. It always seems like everybody is seeing me faster, and killing me faster. I manage to get 0 to 2 kills per game, more is a rarity. I know it will sound much like whining, but here it goes: I can win a 1v1 if I manage to creep up to opponent from the back and even then someone manages to hide, or turn around just in time and 95% of time I lose 1v1 if opponent knows I am there. It seems to me that I am shooting immediately. I'm not sure when this happened by my ATampT Fiber WAN speeds going through pfSense dropped from \~900mbps down/up to 45/115mbps down/up. Nothing changed about my hardware and I haven't touched the config/settings in any way. I'm determining speed by running a speedtest through speedtest.net (https://speedtest.net) to my ISP's nearest server. Is there a checklist of things to go through to diagnose the problem? So far I've ruled out: Memory: I'm hovering around 7% usage 
I recently upgraded from Blast to Extreme (should be 400 mbit) and am still getting speedtest via xfinity's page around 160-200. I've power cycled the modem a few times, and per my router's mail.html page see i have config file: "d11_m_sb8200_extreme400_c01.cm" that certainly looks like the cfg I should have, and I see 32 channels active, and power/SNR/MER are all with acceptable ranges but I'm not too knowledgeable about docsis.
